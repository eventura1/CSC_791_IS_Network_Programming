This is the repo for CSC791 - Network Programming, an independent study covering network programming (socket programming) taken at Dakota State University (DSU) for the Fall-2023 semester. 

The repo will be used to host all the code and material for the class.

The class is self-paced and self-guided with minimal to no instructor assistance. I deviated from the syllabus in some areas based on newly gained knowledge, topics of interest, and the complexity of supporting cross-platform support when programming for both the Unix/Linux and Windows operating systems.
See the Course Information.docx file for more details.
