1.	Provide a general timeline of major Independent Study progress.  Conclude with the delivery date of the final Independent Study summary report.

This is the actual outline of the topics I covered during the semester

1.	Introduction to Network Concepts, Protocols and Utilities (1 weeks).
	•	Researching and understanding network protocols specifications / headers: TCP and UDP.
	•	Capturing and analyzing network traffic.

2. Sockets Programming: The Berkley/POSIX sockets API using the C/C++ programming language. (6 weeks).
	•	Introduction to Sockets and their types.
	•	IPv4 vs IPv6.
	•   Learning how to navigate the socket API, documentation, man pages, etc.
	•	Socket Structures
	•	Socket API and Programming interfaces.
	•	Client-Server Communication using TCP and UDP sockets.
	•	Handling socket errors and exceptions.

During the first 3 weeks of the course I was doing cross-platform network programming but that added a lot of complexity given due to library support across the different
systems, having to account for diffrent error types and bugs. These hurdles took time away from the actual learning and I decided to switch to learning socket prorgamming
on the Linux operating systems. Once I was able to sort that out I got back on track.

3. Intro to Web protocols and programming. Likely using Python (4 weeks).
	•	HTTP
	•	HTTPS, TLS/SSL, OpenSSL.
	•	DNS

4. Intro Network Data representation (2 weeks).
	•	Data Serialization and de-serialization.
	•	XML and JSON.
	•	Protobufs

Briefly covered this topics, not a lot of time writing actual code but understanding how they work and reading through the documentation and design of Protobufs.


7. Final Report (1-2 week). To be delivered during finals’ week.
