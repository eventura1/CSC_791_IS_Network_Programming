Goals:
    Understand how DNS works.
    Get a better understanding of the getaddrinfo() function and related socket structures.

Tasks:

Read the required material and work through the code in the books, add functionality to the programs. The previous module covered a lot of information required for socket programming in general, the bulk of the work in this module is learning how the DNS protocol works and implementing that functionality.

Reading chapter 5 from “Hands-On Network Programming with C" will give us a better understanding of the getaddrinfo() and related socket structures.
