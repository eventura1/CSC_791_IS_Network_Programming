This module will cover TCP sockets in depth, we'll write a TCP client and server application, and explore multiplexing using the fork() and select() functions.
Or maybe we'll write a tcp and a server using the knowledge gained from the previous module.

Now that we have a basic understanding of the different TCP socket functions we're ready to write our first TCP server and client application.

Goals:
    
    * Basic TCP client.
    * Basic TCP server.
    * Multiplexing with fork()
    * Multiplexing with select()
    * The blocking behavior of send().

********************************************************************************

 Summary:
 Built various TCP clients and servers
 Explored multiplexing using select().
 

 Cover how the setup and tear down are connected to each function socket(), bind(), listen(), accept(), close()
